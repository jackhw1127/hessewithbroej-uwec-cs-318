          Hi! I'm Danielle. My whole life, I've loved photography. What fascinates me the most is 
          the ability to capture a moment and freeze it in time. I decided to pursue my passion 
          for photography in college. The knowledge I gained about the technique and art of 
          photography truly propelled my interest to new heights. Photography has greatly impacted 
          and changed our world. I look forward to adding my work to this revolutionary collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          My love behind the lens comes forth in my photography. To me, 
          "Photography is life's elegance preserved in the most beautiful format."
